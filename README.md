- 🔗 You can consider including links to your social media profiles or any other online portfolios you'd like to share!

**Don't Forget to Push Your Work to GitHub:**

- 🚀 Once you're satisfied with your website, open a terminal window and navigate to the _"My-First-Website"_ folder.
- 🌐 Head over to GitHub and create a remote repository. Follow the git commands we discussed to push your local repository to GitHub. This step ensures that your work is safely stored online and can be shared with others.

🚧 Remember, this is your personal space on the internet, and it's a canvas for your creativity. Don't hesitate to experiment, explore, and enjoy the process of building your first personal website using HTML! ✨ *Feel free to personalize the content to reflect yourself.
