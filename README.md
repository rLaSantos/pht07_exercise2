## ✨**Practice Exercise from Day 3**

### HTML Activity

**Get Started with Your First Website Project:**

- 📂 Begin by creating a fresh project folder on your computer. Give it a meaningful name like _"My-First-Website"_ to keep things organized.
- 📄 Inside this folder, craft a new HTML file and consider naming it _home.html_. This will serve as the main page of your website.

**Explore and Experiment:**

- 🔍 Delve into the world of HTML to organize and structure your website content logically. Feel free to use various HTML elements and attributes to enhance the look and feel of your webpage.
- 🎨 Challenge yourself by adding more content and experimenting with different HTML features. This is your chance to unleash your creativity and explore the possibilities HTML offers.

**Personalize Your Website:**

- 🌟 Put a personal touch on your website by adding a title that includes your name or a catchy phrase.
- 👋 Introduce yourself on the webpage. Share information about your interests, hobbies, and skills, and others. Up to you! Remember, this is your opportunity to showcase who you are.
- 🔗 You can consider including links to your social media profiles or any other online portfolios you'd like to share!

**Don't Forget to Push Your Work to GitHub:**

- 🚀 Once you're satisfied with your website, open a terminal window and navigate to the _"My-First-Website"_ folder.
- 🌐 Head over to GitHub and create a remote repository. Follow the git commands we discussed to push your local repository to GitHub. This step ensures that your work is safely stored online and can be shared with others.

🚧 Remember, this is your personal space on the internet, and it's a canvas for your creativity. Don't hesitate to experiment, explore, and enjoy the process of building your first personal website using HTML! ✨ *Feel free to personalize the content to reflect yourself. This activity will lay the groundwork for more advanced web development concepts in the upcoming sessions*💻
